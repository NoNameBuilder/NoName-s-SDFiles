## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- **T-Embed CC1101 Development Board**
- **Arduino IDE** installed on your computer
- **CC1101** library installed in the Arduino IDE (included in this repo)
- **SD card** for data storage
- **SPI** and **SD** libraries for communication

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Install Necessary Libraries

To use the **T-Embed CC1101** board, install the following libraries in the **Arduino IDE**:

- **SPI**: For communication between the **ESP32** and external devices (e.g., **SD card**).
- **SD**: For reading and writing data to the **SD card**.
- **CC1101**: For communication with the integrated **CC1101 RF transceiver**.

To install these libraries:

1. Open the **Arduino IDE**.
2. Go to **Sketch** > **Include Library** > **Manage Libraries**.
3. Search for and install each library (SPI, SD, CC1101).

Alternatively, you can download the **CC1101** library from GitHub and place it in your Arduino libraries folder.

#### 2. Connect the Hardware

The **CC1101** RF transceiver is **integrated** into the **T-Embed CC1101** board, so no external connections are required. Simply insert the **SD card** into the SD card reader slot on the board.

> **Note**: Format your SD card as **FAT32** for compatibility with the **SD** library.

#### 3. Upload Example Code

Once you've installed the libraries and connected the hardware, you can start uploading example code to the **T-Embed CC1101** board.
